üî• Challenges Faced
1Ô∏è‚É£ Permission Issues with npm
Encountered EACCES (permission denied) errors when installing global packages.

Solved by changing ownership of the .npm folder:
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(id -g) ~/.npm

2Ô∏è‚É£ Tailwind Command Not Found (npx tailwindcss init -p Removed)
Tailwind v4 removed the init command, causing confusion.

Fixed by manually creating tailwind.config.js.

3Ô∏è‚É£ npm Cache Errors (EEXIST, EACCESS, mkdir Issues)
Faced npm cache issues when installing packages.

Fixed by cleaning the cache:
npm cache clean --force

4Ô∏è‚É£ Wrong Path for Tailwind CSS Content
Initially, Tailwind styles were not applied.

Fixed by ensuring content paths in tailwind.config.js included all src files.

üéØ Final Thoughts
Setting up React with Tailwind CSS required overcoming several installation and configuration issues, mostly due to npm permissions, Tailwind v4 changes, and Vite-specific setup.

## Why Are Components Important in React?

1. **Reusability**  
   - Components allow us to **reuse** code throughout the application, reducing duplication.  

2. **Modularity**  
   - Each component handles a **specific part** of the UI, making the code more structured and easier to maintain.  

3. **Props for Dynamic Content**  
   - Props allow components to **receive data dynamically**, making them more flexible.  
   - Example: In `HelloWorld.js`, we passed `name="Focus Bear"` to display a personalized message.

4. **Easier Debugging**  
   - Breaking UI into small components makes debugging simpler compared to a large monolithic file.
