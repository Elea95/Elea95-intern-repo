# Understanding Staging vs. Committing in Git

## Difference Between Staging and Committing

- **Staging (`git add`)** prepares changes before committing.
- **Committing (`git commit`)** saves the staged changes in Git history.

## Why Git Separates Staging and Committing

- Allows organizing changes before committing.
- Helps group related modifications into a single commit.
- Prevents committing unfinished work accidentally.

## When to Stage Without Committing

- When working on multiple features but committing them separately.
- When reviewing changes before making them permanent.
- When preparing commits for a clean Git history.

# Understanding Branching & Team Collaboration in Git

## Why Pushing Directly to Main is Problematic

- Changes could break the main branch.
- Unfinished or buggy code could be deployed accidentally.
- No opportunity for review and feedback.

## How Branches Help with Reviewing Code

- Developers can test features in isolation before merging.
- Code reviews via pull requests improve code quality.
- Issues can be addressed without affecting production code.

## What Happens When Two People Edit the Same File on Different Branches?

- A **merge conflict** occurs if the same lines are changed.
- Git requires **manual conflict resolution** before merging.
- Teams use **code reviews and rebase strategies** to manage conflicts.

# Advanced Git Commands & When to Use Them

## 1. git checkout main -- <file>

- **Restores a specific file from the main branch** without affecting other changes.
- **Use case**: If I accidentally modified or deleted a file and want to undo changes.

## 2. git cherry-pick <commit>

- **Applies a single commit** from another branch without merging everything.
- **Use case**: If a teammate made a useful fix but their branch isnâ€™t ready to merge yet.

## 3. git log

- **Displays commit history** with details like author, timestamp, and changes.
- **Use case**: To track code evolution and find past changes.

## 4. git blame <file>

- **Shows who modified each line** in a file and when.
- **Use case**: Helps debug issues by identifying who made the last change.

### What Surprised Me?

- `git cherry-pick` is really powerful for **applying specific changes** without merging a whole branch.
- `git blame` is useful for **understanding why code was changed** before modifying it.
