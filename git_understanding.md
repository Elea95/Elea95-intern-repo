# Understanding Staging vs. Committing in Git

## Difference Between Staging and Committing
- **Staging (`git add`)** prepares changes before committing.  
- **Committing (`git commit`)** saves the staged changes in Git history.  

## Why Git Separates Staging and Committing  
- Allows organizing changes before committing.  
- Helps group related modifications into a single commit.  
- Prevents committing unfinished work accidentally.  

## When to Stage Without Committing  
- When working on multiple features but committing them separately.  
- When reviewing changes before making them permanent.  
- When preparing commits for a clean Git history.
