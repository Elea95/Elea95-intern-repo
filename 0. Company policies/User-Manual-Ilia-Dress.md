My role
I am working on:
· React Native Focus Bear
· Mobile App Development
The days and times I work are:
· Tuesday and Wednesday 9am-5pm
· Saturday and Sunday - some
How I Work Best
I do my best work when...
I'm free of external distractions
I don't have too many meetings
I'm well-rested
I can focus on one thing at a time
I have deadlines
I understand the purpose of the task I'm doing and how it fits into the big picture
Others are able and willing to help
I struggle when...
· I'm interrupted while doing deep work
· It's very noisy
· The work is boring and feels unimportant
Communication Style
I prefer messages to be... (e.g., short and direct, detailed, async, verbal):
· (Short and direct combined with detailed method) The main idea is explained briefly in the first few sentences and then expanded upon in more detail throughout the rest of the text.
The best way to reach me is... (e.g., Discord, email, scheduled calls):
· Priority: 1) Phone number; 2) Email; 3) Discord.
If you need something urgent, do this:
· Call me on my phone
Collaboration & Teamwork
I work best in a team when:
· I understand the team's purpose - what are we trying to achieve?
· We talk respectfully and sometimes even joke around a little
· We have deadlines and each of us has our own task
My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is...
· Everyone for themselves and not helping others
· All talk, no action
· Meetings for the sake of meeting
If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means...
· I'm thinking deeply about the topic or
· I'm very distant
Focus & Productivity
I stay focused by...
· When I'm alone or when everyone around me is focused on work
Things that distract me...
· Meetings
· Calls
· My own brain
The best way to support my productivity is...
· Give me clear deadlines
· Tell me exactly what you need
Feedback & Growth
I like feedback to be...
· (Direct, gentle, with examples, private)
When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is...
· Send me a message or tell me directly, but kindly
I appreciate it when teammates...
· Suggest new ideas
· Question my approaches
· Work together as a team
Fun Facts & Quirks
One thing people often misunderstand about me is...
· That I should know things that everyone else knows (I don't always understand what they're talking about, even though I look like I do)
A fun fact about me...
· I spent 10 days in a mental hospital to avoid joining the army
My work superpower is...
· If there's a deadline and I'm working with a team, I'll try to do my part as best I can
