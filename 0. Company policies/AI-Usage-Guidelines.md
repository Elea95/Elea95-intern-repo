# AI Usage Guidelines

## 🤖 Responsible Use of AI Tools at Focus Bear

### 🏆 When to Use AI

- **For code suggestions** (GitHub Copilot, Tabnine) to speed up development.
- **For generating documentation or summaries** (ChatGPT, Notion AI).
- **For debugging and error explanations** (AI-assisted debugging tools).
- **For research and brainstorming** (AI-powered searches).

### ⛔ When NOT to Use AI

- When handling **confidential company data**.
- When **fully trusting AI-generated code** without reviewing it.
- When working on **security-sensitive features** (e.g., authentication).
- When AI output seems **biased or incorrect**.

### 🔍 Avoiding Over-Reliance on AI

- Always **review and test AI-generated code** before using it.
- Use AI as a **support tool, not a replacement** for critical thinking.
- Learn from AI suggestions rather than copying without understanding.

### 🔒 Ensuring Data Privacy

- **Do not enter confidential data** into AI tools.
- **Use company-approved AI tools** instead of public ones.
- **Validate AI responses** before applying them.

### 🚀 AI Task Improvement & Review

**Task:** I used AI to generate a function for user authentication in React Native.  
**Review:** The AI-generated code had good structure but required security improvements.  
**Lesson:** AI can assist in writing code, but security and best practices must be manually reviewed.

### ✅ Best Practice for AI at Focus Bear

**I will always fact-check AI-generated content before using it in projects.**
