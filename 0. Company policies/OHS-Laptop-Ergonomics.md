# OHS Laptop Ergonomics Reflection

## 🏠 Workspace Improvements

To improve my ergonomic setup, I have:

- **Raised my laptop screen** using a laptop stand to align it with eye level.
- **Started using an external keyboard and mouse** to reduce wrist strain.
- **Adjusted my chair height** so my feet are flat on the floor and my back is supported.

## 💡 Behavioural Adjustments

To reduce strain and improve posture, I will:

- **Take movement breaks every 30–60 minutes** to prevent stiffness.
- **Use the 20-20-20 rule** to reduce eye strain.
- **Sit upright with proper posture** and avoid slouching.
- **Stretch my wrists and shoulders** periodically.

## ⏳ Reminders for Better Ergonomics

To maintain good posture and take breaks, I will:

- **Use Focus Bear’s movement reminders** to prompt me to stand up and stretch.
- **Set a phone or desktop reminder** for posture checks.
- **Organize my workspace** to reduce unnecessary movement and strain.
