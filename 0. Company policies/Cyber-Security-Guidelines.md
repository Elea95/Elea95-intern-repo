# Cyber Security Guidelines

## 🔐 My Cyber Security Practices at Focus Bear

### 🔍 Current Security Measures

- Using unique, strong passwords for accounts.
- Avoiding phishing links and verifying senders before opening emails.
- Keeping my work laptop updated with security patches.
- Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on key accounts.

### 📈 Areas for Improvement

- Start using a password manager to avoid reusing passwords.
- Lock my computer automatically when I step away.
- Be more cautious about using public Wi-Fi.

### 🛠 New Cyber Security Habit

**I will always lock my computer when I step away from my desk, even for a short time, to prevent unauthorized access.**

### 🚨 Security Response Plan

If I suspect a security breach or suspicious activity:

1. Report it immediately to IT/security team.
2. Change affected passwords and enable 2FA if not already enabled.
3. Run a security scan on my device.
4. Check recent login activity for any unauthorized access.
