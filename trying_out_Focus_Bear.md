# 🐻 Trying Out Focus Bear  

## 🎯 First Impressions  
The app feels quite aggressive in its behaviour. It dominates over other applications right from the start, making it hard to manage other tasks.  

## 🤔 Difficulties in Understanding  
- It was a little unclear how to start.  
- I struggled to find information about my account.  
- Since I installed it back in February and wasn’t sure which email I used, I had to create a new account.  

## 📝 One-Sentence Explanation  
Focus Bear is an app designed to help with focus and productivity, but it needs improvements to enhance user experience.  

## 🛠 Suggested Improvements for New Users  
- Reduce the aggressive behaviour of the app (e.g., allow minimizing via `Win + Tab`).  
- Provide clearer instructions on how to get started.  
- Improve account management options so users can easily retrieve their details.
