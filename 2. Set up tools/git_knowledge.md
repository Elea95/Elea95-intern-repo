# Git Knowledge

## Have you used Git before?  
No, it's my first time.

## Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?  
I heard about **GitHub Desktop** because it provides an easy-to-use interface for managing branches and commits. However, I also use Git inside **VS Code** for quick commits and resolving merge conflicts.

## What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?  
I learned how Git tracks changes at every stage and allows easy collaboration. Main thing - it provides an easy-to-use interface for managing branches and commits.
Also, I now understand how branches help keep the main codebase stable while testing new features.
