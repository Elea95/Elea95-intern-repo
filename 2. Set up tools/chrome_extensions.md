# Dev Productivity Chrome Extensions

## Extensions Installed
1. **React Developer Tools**  
   This extension allows me to inspect React components and their states directly from the browser, which is essential for debugging React apps.

2. **Redux DevTools**  
   This extension helps me debug and visualize the Redux state of my application, which is critical for managing complex state in React applications.

3. **JSON Viewer**  
   This extension automatically pretty-prints JSON data, making it easier to read and debug API responses during development.

4. **Lighthouse**  
   Lighthouse helps me run performance audits on my web applications and provides suggestions on how to improve performance, accessibility, and SEO.

## What was the most useful thing you learned?  
The most useful thing I learned was how the **React Developer Tools** allow you to inspect every React component and its state. This is an excellent tool for debugging and understanding how state is passed through components in a React app.
