# Terminal Knowledge

## Which terminal client did you choose? Why?
I chose **Windows Terminal + PowerShell** because it offers a modern UI, tabs, and customization.  

## What customizations (if any) did you make?
So far haven't made any

## What was the most useful command you learned today?
The `git log --oneline` command, which shows commit history in a simple format. It helps track code changes quickly.
